Initialize the following :

                                special randoms (1 to randomly add a special, 1 to decide which one it is, 1 to figure out if it is up or down, 1 to decide by how much, then meeting certain requirements, decide what the news will be, as well as what the local news says, which may trigger a second special event, such as Yankees win the World Series, celebrations causing some drug prices to skyrocket. DEA truck crashes, freeing up tons of drugs in all categories.)
